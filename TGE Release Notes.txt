  
TGE 1.5.2 [24 Apr 2007]
---------

New:
   - added dynamic static mesh lighting
   - turned old static mesh rendering method into the "simple" method used for simple lighting mode and debug rendering mode

Performance:
   - created new static mesh rendering method that renders static and dynamic light at once, reducing rendering overhead
   - bumped lower lighting profiles to static mesh collision hull shadows instead of geometry based
   - avoid rendering calls on meshes which don't require it

Bug Fixes:
   - resolved lighting problems on objects that were mirrored in Torque Constructor
   - light mapping now honors light's castShadows property
   - fixed cases when water block size != 8
   - smoother interpolation of the freecam
   - fixed memory leak in NetEvent
   - several minor changes for the Linux build
   - don't try to do anything after deleting the object in Explosion::processTick()
   - revert incorrect optimization in particle engine [introduced in 1.5.1]
   - fixed dark lighting [introduced in 1.5.1]
   - fixed assert when changing to fullscreen and the mission contains a new constructor dif [introduced in 1.5.1]
   - remove degenerate tris from light mapping [fixes AssertFatal("!");]
   - light type filtering to stop static lights set to affect DTS objects from illuminating static meshes dynamically
   - fixed z-fighting on alpha static mesh surfaces
   - fixed static mesh BVPT issue with choosing bad first plane on pipe-like objects
   - fixed smoothing detection
   - fixed lighting profiles
   - avoid static mesh hulls in DTS environment lighting
   - block dynamic shadows on static meshes
   - fixed debug interior render mode
   - fixed incorrect include for compiling fonttool
   - fixed several map2dif_plus errors

Removed:
   - really old Max and Maya SDKs from the lib directory:
      - maxsdk31
      - mayasdk4
      - mayasdk5

Known Issues With Constructor Integration
-----------------------------------------

- lighting of static meshes
    - static meshes only support static lighting
    - flipped objects (both brushes and static meshes) still produce odd shading
