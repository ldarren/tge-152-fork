# -DUSE_FILE_REDIRECT: enable fileio redirection to home directory.  The 
#   exact location is ~/.PREF_DIR_ROOT/PREF_DIR_GAME_NAME.  These are set in
#   platformX86UNIX.h.  You can disable redirection at run time with the
#   -nohomedir command line paramater.  Files will then be stored in the game
#   directory, like the windows version.
# -MD: generate .d dependency makefiles.  These are necessary if you want
#   to cleanly do partial builds.  
# -w: disable all warnings
# -fno-exceptions is safe to use (if your code doesn't use exceptions), 
#    but it is disabled by default
# -fno-check-new is not tested
